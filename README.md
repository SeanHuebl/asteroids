# Asteroids Game (Pygame)

This project is a simple **Asteroids** game built using **Pygame**, a popular Python library for writing video games. The game involves controlling a spaceship, dodging and shooting asteroids, and staying alive as long as possible.

## Features
- Player-controlled spaceship with rotation and movement.
- Shooting mechanics with cooldowns to limit rapid fire.
- Asteroids spawn randomly and split into smaller pieces when destroyed.
- Simple collision detection between the player, asteroids, and shots.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have **Python** and **Pygame** installed.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url/asteroids-game
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd asteroids-game
   ```

3. Install Pygame if it's not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play
- Use the **W** and **S** keys to move forward and backward.
- Use the **A** and **D** keys to rotate the ship.
- Press **Spacebar** to shoot asteroids.
- Try to survive by avoiding or destroying asteroids. Larger asteroids will break into smaller pieces when hit.

## Project Timeline
While this project was completed at a later date than my **Static Site Generator** project, this game was technically developed first and was a simpler challenge overall. The Asteroids project was a new addition to my coursework, and I decided to revisit and complete it for the sake of gaining more experience with game development concepts.

## Lessons Learned
- Gained experience working with **Pygame** for real-time game development.
- Implemented basic game mechanics like movement, shooting, and collision detection.
- This project helped me become more comfortable with **classes**, **inheritance**, and **method overloading** in Python.
- Practiced structuring a game project using sprite classes to manage different game objects.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed as part of my coursework to gain a deeper understanding of game mechanics and **Pygame** development.
